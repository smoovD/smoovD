# User Manual: Working with Me

**Role:** Engineering Manager / Data Leader / Snark as a Service Purveyor

**Pronouns:** He/Him

## What This Is

This document is a bunch of words born of introspection, observation, and feedback I have received over many years of trying to understand who "I" am. If I did it well, it will be a cheat code of sorts that allows you and I to work well together, quickly.

---

## Core Values and How They Show Up

### Craft, Care, and Coherence

I view engineering and leadership as a craft. Whether I’m building a data pipeline or a team structure, I care deeply about logic, symmetry, and systemic integrity. Small inconsistencies tend to compound over time, so I naturally gravitate toward addressing them early.

**What this means for you:** I will notice details others may gloss over, especially if they affect long-term stability.

---

### Sound Reasoning over Hand-Waving

I’m allergic to hand-wavy logic. If something doesn’t add up, I’ll ask questions—not to be difficult, but to make the thinking stronger. I’m very comfortable holding multiple competing ideas at once *if* they’re grounded in clear reasoning.

**Important nuance:**
I don’t expect perfection. I *do* expect us to label uncertainty honestly. Assumptions are fine. Guessing is fine. Presenting guesses as facts is not.

---

### Directness and Trust

I value direct, transparent communication and tend to pick up on misalignment quickly. I’d much rather surface something awkward early than let it quietly degrade trust or momentum.

**What builds trust with me:** clear intent, intellectual honesty, and a willingness to say “I don't know.”

---

### Agency Through Information

I believe agency comes from access to context and data. My default leadership move is to share information broadly so people can make good decisions without waiting for permission.

**What this means:** if you want context, ask. I’m rarely trying to withhold it.

---

## How I Tend to Work

### Balancing Integrity and Pragmatism

I care deeply about doing things *the right way*, but I’m not dogmatic about process. If a rule protects security, correctness, or people, I’ll follow it closely. If a process exists without a clear purpose, I’ll question it and look for a better path.

I take calculated risks—not reckless ones—and I think carefully about trade-offs before acting.

---

### Systems Thinking, Not Firefighting Alone

I’m comfortable in urgent situations, but I’m always scanning for root causes. Fixing the immediate issue matters; preventing the next one matters more.

---

### Continuous Learning Is Non-Negotiable

My career has been shaped by constant upskilling, and I see learning as a core professional responsibility. I’m energized by people who are curious, reflective, and open to updating their thinking.

---

## Idea Generation and Brainstorming

I generate a lot of ideas. Not all of them are meant to survive.

### Exploratory Ideation

I often need to hear an idea *out loud* to understand whether it’s good. I may float something extreme or half-formed just to see how it reacts in the world.

- Most early ideas are **5–25% serious**
- If I’m above **60% serious**, I’m thinking about execution

You can always ask: **“How serious are you about this?”**

---

### How to Engage When I’m Brainstorming

When I’m ideating, I’m not asking you to defend the idea—I’m asking you to help *test* it.

The most helpful responses are:

- What could work here
- What the real risks are (not hypothetical ones)
- How we might de-risk or iterate
- A better alternative built on the same intent

What *doesn’t* work well for me is stopping at reasons something won’t work without engaging in solutions.

---

## Communication Preferences

### Written > Verbal (Usually)

For complex topics, I strongly prefer written communication (Slack, Notion, docs). Writing forces clarity and synthesis, and I think best when I can read and reflect.

**Reality check:** while I value async communication, I’m also human and sometimes jump between messages. If something is time-sensitive or especially important, it helps to say so explicitly.

---

### Feedback

I genuinely want feedback, especially if something I’m doing is creating friction. I prefer async feedback so I can digest it thoughtfully before responding.

---

### About Silence

If I go quiet in a conversation, I’m usually processing—sometimes frustration, sometimes complexity, sometimes both. Silence doesn’t mean you did something wrong.

You’re always welcome to check in or ask what’s going on; I’ll answer honestly when asked directly.

---

## How to Work Best With Me (Practical Edition)

- Bring problems early
- Share your thinking, not just conclusions
- Be explicit about assumptions and uncertainty
- Engage in iterative solutioning, not just problem framing
- Tell me when you need a decision vs. exploration
- If you’re blocked, say so—I care more about momentum than appearances

I do my best work when I’m excited—when something is new, interesting, or clearly helps someone. Energy matters to me more than polish.

---

## Human Context (Because This Matters Too)

When I’m not modernizing systems, I gravitate toward slow, tactile, off-screen pursuits.

- I enjoy long, intentional cooking projects, interesting wine, and thinking about *why* something tastes the way it does.
- I spend time woodworking, making jewelry, and working with my hands—craft matters to me, whether it’s code or copper.
- I love high fantasy, hard sci-fi, philosophy, and art that explores identity, systems, or meaning.
- I’ve spent time around Burning Man culture and appreciate curiosity, experimentation, and community—without needing to make it my personality.
- I’m outdoorsy but not heroic about it. I do not like the cold and will not pretend otherwise.
